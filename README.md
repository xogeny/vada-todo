# TodoMVC

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xogeny/vada-todo.png)](https://travis-ci.org/xogeny/vada-todo)

This is an implementation of TodoMVC that uses React, TypeScript,
Redux and a module I developed called
[`vada`](http://github.com/xogeny/vada).

To run the application, simply clone this repository:

```
git clone http://github.com/xogeny/vada-todo
```

Then run `npm install` to download all dependencies.  Once that is
done, you can run the test cases by running `npm test`.  These tests
exercise the application logic.

You can run the application as a React application by running
`webpack` in the root directory and then opening the file `index.html`
(also in the root directory).
